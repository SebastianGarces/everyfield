# EveryField workflow tools

Intent plans, delegates and records decisions. evf supplies briefs, worktrees, local checks,
case checks, feedback routing, progress and merge guards. Run `bin/evf help` for commands.

## Phase 7

Build in one task worktree and preview it through portless. Use the shared development database,
which may be wiped and reseeded, never production. Vercel builds production from main only.
Include current main, commit and run `bin/evf verify <task>`. Logs and checks.json live under
the Git common directory. Local checks do not prove application acceptance or mint approval.

A verifier from another model family exercises the real branch, records an exact-head review
on the PR and runs `evf ship`. Ship reads the PR's required GitHub check status, refuses missing
or nonpassing CI, verifies the recorded head and model families and checks the PR body against
the PR standard template. It squash-merges only that head. Branch changes require fresh CI
and review. The verifier or coordinator runs ship; never arm GitHub auto-merge.
The ship skill defines the review record and owner approval exceptions.

Model families are `openai` and `anthropic`, not individual model names. Authors put
`EVF-Author: <family>` in the body. Verifiers put one JSON line in their PR comment:

```text
EVF-Review: {"head":"<full SHA>","verifierFamily":"anthropic","verdict":"approved"}
```

Use `changes_requested` for failure. The latest valid review record at that head wins.
These unsigned statements rely on the coordinator assigning the actual models correctly.
They do not authenticate a model provider. GitHub comments allow agents sharing the owner's
account to record independent review without GitHub's self-review restriction.

The required section list for ordinary PRs is `.agents/skills/everyfield-pr/template.md`.
Wiki article and prototype PRs already use separate owner routes in
`.agents/skills/ship/SKILL.md`; they use the class templates in `tools/evf/templates/`.
All formats require EVF-Author and host attribution. Keep the Wiki template's screenshot
markers inside Verification so `bin/wiki pr-images --update-body` updates images in place.
`bin/evf pr body --body-file <file>` checks a local ordinary body; add `--class wiki` or
`--class prototype` to preview another format. `bin/evf pr body <PR>` reads the body and PR
metadata from GitHub. A `wiki/<slug>` branch qualifies only when every changed file is under
`docs/reference/wiki/`. A prototype requires a `task/fb-<number>` branch and the `prototype`
label. Other PRs keep the ordinary format. Missing metadata never selects a lighter format.
These formats grant no merge authority; Wiki articles and prototypes still need Sebastian's
approval through `evf approve`. Neither body check needs CI or a review, so the light
PR-open/edit/label CI job can use it. The template comes from the current checkout; missing
or empty templates fail. `evf pr open --body-file` resolves relative paths from the caller's
working directory before invoking GitHub in the task worktree.

## Task and case checks

Briefs use the current catalog and context manifest. Missing context fails explicitly.
Task starts retain kickoff gates and producer dependencies. OPS tasks use reviewed title,
owning paths and tooling checks in `maintenanceTasks`; they cannot authorize application code.
An owning path naming an existing folder must end in `/`; paths without it name exact files.
`taskRisks` can mark sensitive work, which requires an owner decision. Paid services retain
concrete spending approval. Doctor reports readiness without executing checks or changing settings.

For WP tasks, `evf verify` writes `scope.json` beside checks.json and prints a summary. It lists
each changed path as owned (from the base DAG), accepted by one narrow ruling, or outside. The
rulings are: the package's new lock importer and nothing else in `pnpm-lock.yaml` (D14); the
package.json, tsconfig.json and eslint.config.mjs of a new package folder (D16); appended cases
for the package's own `case_requirements_at_start` (D16); and the context manifest, DAG and build
plan only when the generators reproduce them from base inputs plus those cases (D16). The report
is advisory (D18): `evf verify` and `evf pr open` print one line per accepted and outside path,
and the verifier checks every outside path against a recorded ruling. `task start`
fails when `stack up` fails. Stack and check commands named `node` run on evf's Node 24.
`evf principles --apply OPS-<n>` writes into that task's worktree, never the home checkout.
Milestones carry the four case and gate portion lists that the build explorer reads; evf leaves
them empty (D20). `node tools/evf/progress.ts --reconcile <root>` adds them to older milestones.

Use `AC:<case-id>` in passing test names or annotations. Each check gets its own EVF_TEST_REPORT path
(also `{testReport}`), `<position>-<name>.tests.json`, so names that slug alike never share a file. Case coverage runs only when some report has an `AC:` marker (D19):

```json
{"tests":[{"name":"AC:CASE-ID observed behavior","status":"passed"}]}
```

A supplied report must cover selected cases. The verifier independently checks real behavior,
including applicable database, browser and failure paths. Broad temporary checks stay outside
the repo; permanent tests follow test-standard. Before building, check owned cases and action
ordering with docs/acceptance/check.py and docs/package-context.py --check-case-actions.

Run tooling regressions with `bin/evf test`. Disposable repositories and fake GitHub responses
exercise workflow behavior only. Tests contact no real GitHub or application database.

## Browser checks and process hygiene

`evf browser run [--timeout <s>] [--session <name>] -- <command>` runs a browser check in its own
process group (D35). Every process it starts carries an `EVF_BROWSER_RUN` token in its environment,
so cleanup also finds browsers that leave the group, as Playwright browsers and the agent-browser
daemon do. After a pass, a failure, a timeout (exit 124) or a signal to evf, it closes the run's
agent-browser session, stops the tagged processes (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL) and deletes the run's
TMPDIR, which holds Playwright profiles. It fails when a process survives SIGKILL.
`evf doctor` lists headless browsers and agent-browser daemons older than 15 minutes
(`--browser-age <minutes>`) with PID, age and tree memory. It reports only; owners close their own.
`evf verify` reminds the caller to keep the turn open, and warns when a terminal runs it as a
background job. Agent shells look the same in both modes, so the reminder prints every time.

## Feedback and human ownership

The original P0/P1 immediate, P2/P3 Monday, small-feature draft-prototype, large-feature idea, duplicate/question/spam rubric remains in `.agents/roles/feedback-desk.md`. No new severity rubric replaces it.

Configure verified numeric `botAuthorId`, `triageActorIds` and `ownerActorIds`. P0/P1 fixes merge through the verifier (`mergePolicy.feedbackVerifierMerge`). P2/P3 fixes are verified by `evf ship` and then wait (`feedbackOwnerAfterVerifier`); `evf approve` merges them after Sebastian approves in chat. Prototypes merge through `evf approve` only. Use separate agent and human credentials. Direct mutation paths validate bot provenance and explicit actor trust; the currently authenticated account is never automatically trusted. Source repository numeric/node IDs, issue number/node ID, original public summary and locator are frozen. A changed repository cannot reinterpret an existing FB number; the private internal repository is bound too. Repository renames with the same immutable identity preserve the original locator.

The inbound public issue must match the reviewed closed publisher title/body templates, approved public-area list and opaque UUID marker; bot authorship alone does not authorize arbitrary raw text. Those adapter protocol fields are empty until the actual publisher contract is reviewed. Nonconforming/richer public text is held for authorized human triage; the automated model path receives only the closed projection.

Automatic public triage contains a fixed class/status, optional verified public duplicate number and opaque token. Private reason, area, feature/package routing and actor ID stay private. HTML comments are public. An arbitrary reply is blocked unless a configured owner approves the exact source/body SHA-256 in `replyApprovals`; the reviewed question-answer path then posts that exact reply and closes the question. Without a reviewed reply, a question remains open. Large ideas retain demand ranking and owner-approved promotion via `promotionApprovals`; promotion creates private planning evidence, not implementation permission.

Feedback starts require a reviewed current package/context and matching feature scope. P0/sensitive work and over-limit P0 exceptions require recorded owner approval; severity itself grants no authority. Tasks may record sensitive risk in `taskRisks` or their maintenance entry. Nonordinary tasks stop before implementation or merge and escalate through Intent’s existing owner channel; the scoped owner-approval receipt adapter remains unconfigured. The definitive sensitive-scope policy and approved start records must be supplied at the external handoff; this task does not decide broader autonomous authority. A native private-original/reproduction bridge remains unconfigured. Purpose-filtered reproduction access must preserve private-care/security exclusions before any model/runtime access.

Daily slots count actual starts plus current reservations, never triage-cache presence. Reusing a completed start consumes one slot; a historical reservation must charge the actual new start day. The quiet-day queue includes new intake, due P2/P3 Monday work, immediately due backlog and unresolved reservations. Previously budget-held work returns when a later day has room. Concurrent local mutations fail on the lock; stale/incomplete lock ownership requires explicit reconciliation rather than a racing takeover.

Internal creation is source-marker keyed in a verified private repo. A lost response becomes `unknown`; retry first searches for the exact marker and reconciles a single existing issue, refusing zero/ambiguous unknown outcomes. Public shipped updates record pending/unknown/complete outcomes and never report closure after a failed call. Inspect provider evidence and record a reviewed reconciliation before retrying unknown writes; do not delete caches or blindly repeat them.

## Progress and recovery

Only evf writes canonical progress on ship and coordinator acknowledgement. Read
[the coordinator workflow](../../docs/build-agent-workflow.md). Retained records preserve CI,
review, merge and owning-path evidence. Full package closure belongs to integration.
WP-097's documentary fast-track import remains available with its original owner go-live record.

Reconcile plan membership with Node 24+ `tools/evf/progress.ts --reconcile`, then transfer its
output through reviewed OPS maintenance. Never discard dirty shared checkouts or change their
branches while another agent is working. Configure GitHub settings only with current owner
approval. W2 owns the CI workflow, branch protection and GitHub auto-merge setup.
