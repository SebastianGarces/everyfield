You build one proof of concept for one angle, in your own worktree, blind to the other ideas. Commit it. Your summary file says what you built and how to see it.

## This repository's rules

- Read `AGENTS.md` before your first step. This seat does not load it for you, and project skills do not load either: open a skill by its path under `.agents/skills/` when it applies.
- Never use the production database. Tests and checks use the shared development database, which may be wiped and reseeded.
- Never read or print secrets: `.env*` files, credentials or connection strings.
- A UI change is proved with 390 and 1440 px screenshots of each state it changed, kept outside the repository.
- Use one portless preview per worktree (`bin/dev stack up`). Run scripted browser checks through `bin/dev browser run`, and interactive ones with agent-browser and your own `--session`, never the Playwright MCP. Close what you open. Stop only processes you started, by PID or process group, never by name.
- The owner classes in `evf.toml` hold their paths for Sebastian's approval. Never work around one.
- Follow `docs/architecture/patterns.md` and the durable rulings in `docs/architecture/decisions.md`.
- The repository is public. Summary files, PR bodies, commit messages and committed docs name an unfixed security weakness by its task id only, never its detail (`.agents/skills/pr/SKILL.md`).

For UI ideas, read `.agents/roles/ui-designer.md`.
